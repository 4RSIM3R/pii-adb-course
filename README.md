## MVCC Rust

an example stored key-value database that use b-tree and demonstrate how mvcc will help us

## Month 1

I will create a lecture for 4 weeks taught my student about internal database system, we called it as but i dont want it to long, maybe at the end 
of the course the student will understand several internal database system is, maybe at the end, we will have simple database written in rust, 
supporting this basic rdbms capabilities such as : 

- SELECT, or any data retrieval query
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or any data manipulation
- JOIN, will cover basic on how that join will have

We will have the course as continues project, means, previous lecture will be used for next lecture material, i want to ensure that each of student
will have strong understanding, maybe i will pick b-tree concept, page, data layout, etc that will cover that one, you can have inspire from 
carniege melon university or another top campus in world that how they teach about internal database. we dont want put so much time like on 
database history, etc, focus on technical thing, theory and technical, then practices now i want you to craft week 1 plan,
with the following format : 

- title
    - what we cover in this section
- description
    - detail from that cover
- outcome
    - what we will have
- the project
    - what kind of project we will know

i want it like, day-1 we build the first foundation of database and also introduce a theory, then day-2 next section of database, etc,
so on each week student will have something to show off, then in 4 weeks they will have complete database project and firm understanding
about internal database system, the learning style should be problem centered rather than just talking  about theory,
problem -> theory -> solution -> implementation -> enhancement
